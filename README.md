House price prediction is the process of forecasting the future selling price of residential properties based on various factors such as location, size, amenities, market trends, economic indicators, and historical sales data. It is a crucial task in real estate, assisting buyers, sellers, investors, and real estate agents in making informed decisions.

Several methods are employed for house price prediction, including statistical models, machine learning algorithms, and artificial intelligence techniques. These methods utilize historical data to train predictive models, which can then be used to estimate the price of a house given its features.

Key factors considered in house price prediction include:

Location: Proximity to amenities such as schools, hospitals, transportation, and recreational facilities.
Property characteristics: Size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, lot size, age of the property, and architectural style.
Market trends: Supply and demand dynamics, interest rates, inflation, and economic indicators affecting the real estate market.
Comparable sales: Recent sales prices of similar properties in the area (comps).
Neighborhood characteristics: Crime rates, school ratings, employment opportunities, and overall livability.
Property condition: Renovations, upgrades, and maintenance history.
House price prediction models can range from simple linear regression models to complex ensemble methods and neural networks. These models are trained on historical data, validated using techniques such as cross-validation, and then tested on unseen data to assess their predictive performance.

Accuracy in house price prediction is essential for ensuring fair transactions, minimizing risks for buyers and lenders, and maximizing returns for sellers and investors. However, predicting house prices accurately can be challenging due to the dynamic nature of real estate markets and the multitude of factors influencing property values. Therefore, continuous monitoring, updating models, and incorporating new data are essential for maintaining the relevance and reliability of house price prediction systems.House price prediction model is an application developed by using FLASK.
By using ML algorithms the model predicts the total cost of a house which will predict basing on customer requirements.
